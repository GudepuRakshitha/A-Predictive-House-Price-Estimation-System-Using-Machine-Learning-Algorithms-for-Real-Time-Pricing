# A Predictive House Price Estimation System Using Machine Learning Algorithms for Real-Time Pricing

## 📌 Project Overview

This project involves building a **Predictive Model for House Price Estimation** using machine learning techniques. The system predicts real estate prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and available amenities. It is designed for real-time estimation, providing accurate and interpretable results to assist buyers, sellers, and agents in making informed decisions.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 📍 Uses location, area, number of bedrooms, and amenities to predict prices
- 🔢 Implements machine learning regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis and feature engineering
- 🧠 Model training and evaluation using performance metrics (RMSE, R²)
- 🌐 Optional UI with **Streamlit** for interactive prediction

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – Visualizations
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models and evaluation
- **Streamlit** (optional) – For a real-time web interface
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For model experimentation and visualization

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares housing data, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numeric features.
2. **Model Training**: Trains one or more regression models using scikit-learn (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest).
3. **Evaluation**: Calculates metrics like R², RMSE to assess performance.
4. **Prediction**: Uses trained model to estimate house prices based on new input features.
5. **Deployment**: Streamlit app provides a user-friendly web interface for real-time prediction.
